# ASCII-Art-Generator
This is a program that takes in an image and converts it into ASCII art.

# How this works?
This application takes in a picture and splits it into a grid of small squares. It then takes the brightness of each square and assigns it an ASCII character that has a similar brightness rating. It repeats this process for each small square to form a new ASCII picture.
